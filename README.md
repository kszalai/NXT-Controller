#<img src="https://github.com/kszalai/NXT-Controller/blob/master/app/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher.png" /> NXT Control - Android App
This app is a controller for a Lego NXT Mindstorms Robot.
Connection is done through Bluetooth.
This controller lets you drive your robot with 2 servo motors.
We made 2 modes of driving available in the app.
<ul>
<li>Directional Touch Driving</li>
<li>Accelerometer Driving</li>
</ul>
The app will also tell you how much battery is left on your robot.
There is also a tab in the app where you can see the sensors available on the robot, but that is not functional as it was not required for the class.
